To Add:
- Refactor main clock into clock scheduler because each track currently has its own quarter note position
- Saving song to WAV using OfflineAudioContext, will require simulating playback between each meta event
- MP3 track
- MP3 sampler track
- Global Song Manager (controls scheduling event, etc)
- Effects chains
- Global effects bus for high cost effects (attached to a subclass of audio context most likely)
- Saving and loading

Fixes:
- If playback starts after last note, last note plays infinitely
- Possible refactor of BaseTrack and BaseInstrument
