To Add backend:
- Add magic header to save file
- Finish TODOs

To Add UI: 
- Ability to add note groups and one shot playbacks (depending on the track) from the timeline view
- Add a timeline marker that moves with the current position of the song in the songManager (likely needs to be done using GetAnimationFrame)
- Scrollbars, both vertical and horizontal
- Make note groups interactable which would then take the user to a sequencer style page where the current note group is loaded and the user can edit it
- Ability to add time signature and bpm changes at the top of the screen
- zooming still has rare bugs resulting in all bars disappearing then errors

- Connections for tracks with chains and global bus - https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable
