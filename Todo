To Add backend:
- Add magic header to save file
- Finish TODOs

To Add UI: 
- Loading spinners, for async operations like loading in a new file: https://chevtek.io/how-to-create-versatile-loading-spinner-management-in-react/

- Add selected effect to TrackTimelineEvents
- Scrollbars, both vertical and horizontal
- Ability to move all notes in a note group in the sequencer view.
- Update TrackTimelineEvent width on drag, not only on mouse release

Other:
- Coherency across browser, particularly in areas like sliders, padding and margins where rendering could differ among browsers
- Look at react rendering: check react objects are not unnecessarily rerendering (PureComponent vs Component)
- Look at licenses for dependencies before deploying, need to figure out the best way to include them.
