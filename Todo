To Add backend:
- Add magic header to save file
- Finish TODOs

To Add UI: 
- Generate note groups in the UI - essentially treat them as bars - 
    check which note group is the next to add for all tracks, add it when it gets too close to the right
    and remove it when it gets too far from the left, etc.
- This would then work the same for mp3 tracks.
- Then need to support adding note groups and mp3 track playbacks
- Possibly do this by storing beat width in the bartimeline? Then the scroll position could be calculated virtually even though the x is reset after every scroll event.
- Scrolling in general needs to be made more robust, need to be able to arbitrarily scroll to a given location 
    (can kind of do that at the moment using regenerate bars - possibly redo this function to support not only a bar number,
    but a beat position in general)
- Zooming needs to zoom at the mouse position (use mouseover and mouseoff to track whether mouse scroll events should activate on the timeline or not)

- GENERALLY, the scrolling should all be done using a beat position, then the backend should support converting that and displaying it correctly
