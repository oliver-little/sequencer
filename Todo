To Add:
- Meta event track (bpm and time signature changes)
- Saving song to WAV using OfflineAudioContext, will require simulating playback between each meta event
- MP3 track
- MP3 sampler track
- Global Song Manager (controls scheduling event, etc)
- Effects chains
- Global effects bus for high cost effects (attached to a subclass of audio context most likely)
- Saving and loading

Fixes:
- Possible refactor of BaseTrack and BaseInstrument
