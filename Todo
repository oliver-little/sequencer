To Add backend:
- Add magic header to save file
- Finish TODOs

To Add UI: 
- Fix TrackTimelineEvent dragging so that the event always moves when the mouse crosses a snap line in bar space, not in the screen space
- Similarly, vertical dragging of NoteTimelineEvents does not move on the horizontal line, it moves at arbitrary points.
- Add selected effect to TrackTimelineEvents
- Scrollbars, both vertical and horizontal
- Ability to move all notes in a note group in the sequencer view.
- Selective PIXI imports to reduce package size

- Connections for tracks with chains and global bus - https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable

Other:
- Look at licenses for dependencies before deploying, need to figure out the best way to include them.

BUG FIXES:
- Rare bug where long SoundFileTracks will be provided with a negative start time
- Look at code for notes in SequencerTimeline and SequencerNotes, the implementation is confusing
