To Add backend:
- Add magic header to save file
- Finish TODOs

To Add UI: 
- Add selected effect to TrackTimelineEvents
- Scrollbars, both vertical and horizontal
- Ability to move all notes in a note group in the sequencer view.
- Selective PIXI imports to reduce package size
- Loading spinners, for async operations like loading in a new file: https://chevtek.io/how-to-create-versatile-loading-spinner-management-in-react/

- Connections for tracks with chains and global bus - https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable

Other:
- Look at licenses for dependencies before deploying, need to figure out the best way to include them.

BUG FIXES:
- Rare bug where long SoundFileTracks will be provided with a negative start time
- Look at code for notes in SequencerTimeline and SequencerNotes, the implementation is confusing
- Implementation of contentHeight is also more complex than it might need to be
