To Add backend:
- Add magic header to save file
- Finish TODOs

To Add UI: 
- Fix TrackTimelineEvent dragging so that the event always moves when the mouse crosses a snap line in bar space, not in the screen space
- Similarly, vertical dragging of NoteTimelineEvents does not move on the horizontal line, it moves at arbitrary points.
- Add selected effect to TrackTimelineEvents
- Scrollbars, both vertical and horizontal
- Ability to move all notes in a note group in the sequencer view.
- Selective PIXI imports to reduce package size

- Connections for tracks with chains and global bus - https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable

Other:
- Look at licenses for dependencies before deploying, need to figure out the best way to include them.

BUG FIXES:
- After changing the time signature (denominator) some events which have been MOVED after they were originally placed seem to jump forwards or backwards depending on what the denominator was changed to.
