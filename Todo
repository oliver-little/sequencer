To Add:
- Effects chains - chains can emulate nodes, and multiple instruments could use one chain. Global bus would be a chain used by all tracks.
- Global effects bus for high cost effects (attached to a subclass of audio context most likely)
- Saving and loading
- Saving song to WAV - half complete, need to be able to save song data in order to recreate songManager using offlineaudiocontext

Fixes:
- If playback starts after last note, last note plays infinitely
- Possible refactor of BaseTrack and BaseInstrument
